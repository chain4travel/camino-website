YOU ARE REQUIRED TO READ THE LATEST AVAILABLE VERSION OF THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE WEBSITE IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE PARTICIPATING IN THE TOKEN SALE.</p>

<p>THE INFORMATION SET OUT IN THIS LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS, RISKS AND DISCLAIMER MAY NOT BE EXHAUSTIVE AND DOES NOT FORM PART OF ANY CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP. WHILE WE MAKE EVERY REASONABLE EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE WEBSITE IS ACCURATE AND UP-TO-DATE, SUCH MATERIAL DOES NOT CONSTITUTE PROFESSIONAL ADVICE. INDIVIDUALS WHO INTEND TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE CAMINO (ALSO REFERRED TO AS "CAM") TOKEN SHOULD SEEK INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE BEFORE ACTING ON ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED.</p>

<h2>1.- LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>

<p>The Camino Network Foundation has used reasonable efforts to conduct the sale and purchase of the Camino (also referred to as "CAM") token (the "Tokens") in a responsible and reasonable manner. Given the legal uncertainty surrounding distributed ledger technologies, businesses and activities, as well as cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related businesses and activities, in various jurisdictions, the Camino Network Foundation has spent time and resources considering its business approach and where it proposes to operate now and in the future. The Camino Network Foundation has worked with a European and Swiss law firm with respect to European and Swiss law matters. The Camino Network Foundation has not sought any other legal advice in any other jurisdiction. As such, the Tokens subject to the Token Sale may constitute a security in your jurisdiction, or the offer for sale of the Tokens by the Camino Network Foundation may constitute a regulated or prohibited activity in your jurisdiction, and in either case the Camino Network Foundation may be liable. The Camino Network Foundation assumes no responsibility or liability to you in these or any other circumstances. You are strongly advised to seek independent legal advice regarding the legality in the jurisdiction of your participation in the Token Sale.</p>

<p>Tokens are utility tokens intended for use only on the Camino Network. Tokens are not securities. If you purchase tokens, your purchase cannot be refunded or exchanged. The Camino Network Foundation does not recommend purchasing Tokens for speculative investment purposes. Tokens do not entitle you to any equity, governance, voting or similar rights or entitlements in the Camino Network Foundation. Tokens are sold as digital products, similar to downloadable software, digital music, and the like. The Camino Network Foundation does not recommend that you purchase Tokens unless you have prior experience with cryptographic tokens, blockchain-based software and distributed ledger technology, and have sought independent professional advice.</p>


<h2>2.- REGIONAL RESTRICTIONS</h2>

<p>The Website and all the Available Information contained therein (including the product described on the Website) are not directed to or intended for use by any person(s) who are subject to legal provisions (based on their nationality, domicile, or any other reasons) according to which accessing the Website and/or distributing the Available Information on the Website is prohibited with or without having obtained a license or authorization. </p>

<p>In particular, any person or entity, including any person or entity acting on its behalf, located, resident, domiciled or incorporated in Restricted Countries shall not acquire or use the Tokens and shall immediately leave this Website, failing which such person or entity shall assume all responsibility and liability arising from the continued use of this Website, the Available Information and/or the Tokens and shall indemnify The Camino Network Foundation for any and all damages arising therefrom. </p>

<p>The Camino Network Foundation reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take reasonable organizational and technical measures to ensure that the Websites, the Available Information and the Tokens are not available to buyers from Restricted Countries. Due to the fact that the Tokens are offered on the Internet (World Wide Web), the Camino Network Foundation and the buyers understand that there is a possibility of a certain "flow back" of Tokens to Restricted Countries. The Camino Network Foundation therefore expressly prohibits buyers from restricted countries from using Tokens. The Camino Network Foundation will not be liable for any legal or financial consequences resulting from such use. Such persons who use Tokens in spite of this prohibition shall, upon first request, indemnify and hold harmless the Camino Network Foundation from and against any and all legal or monetary consequences arising out of their violation of these Legal Considerations, Risks and Disclaimer and shall immediately cease using the Available Information and/or Tokens and leave the Website.</p>
