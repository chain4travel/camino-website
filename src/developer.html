            <h2>Validator voting</h2>
            <p>We are changing the conditions of how to become and what it means to be a validator. For example, the stake itself does not equal power on the network and does not control the amount of rewards earned for the validation. Each validator has the same amount of stake and is also a KYC-/KYB-verified entity of the travel industry. Basically, we're not talking about a permissionless PoS anymore but a public & permissioned PoSA concept.</p>

                <h2>Gas fee voting</h2>
                <p>We changed the way how transaction fees are computed and will allow the consortia to vote on the amount of gas fees payable to keep them at a reasonable and competitive level for the travel industry.</p>

                <h2>KYB proof</h2>
                <p>The network participants and, thus, big travel industry entities will not be willing to validate transactions on a foreign network they don't trust. Furthermore, foreign networks also have significantly higher hardware requirements and touchpoints outside their business segment.</p>
