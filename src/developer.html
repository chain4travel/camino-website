            <h2>Validator voting</h2>
            <p>We are changing the conditions of how to become and what it means to be a validator. For example, the stake itself does not equal power on the network and does not control the amount of rewards earned for the validation. Each validator has the same amount of stake and is also a KYC-/KYB-verified entity of the travel industry. Basically, we're not talking about a permissionless PoS anymore but a semi-permissioned PoSA concept.</p>
