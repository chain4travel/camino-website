Camino Network enters 2025 with a comprehensive development plan focused on the growth of the web3 travel ecosystem through partnerships, use cases, transactions, and dApps deployed. This roadmap addresses key technical implementations and delivers practical benefits for travel businesses - possible, thanks to the web3 infrastructure.

## üèóÔ∏è Core infrastructure improvements

The network's tech foundation will be strengthened through automated testing frameworks to ensure reliable performance and reduced system failures. The Cairo phase of the protocol will establish network independence, optimize fee structures, and improve transaction speed - critical factors for large-scale business operations.

## üí≥ TravelFi: travel financial solutions on-chain

Camino Network will launch new travel payment solutions through integration with EURe and EURSH stablecoins, along with additional providers. This step will enable new B2B travel use cases built on Camino Network, thanks to faster settlements, reduced transaction costs, and multiple payment options.

## üõ†Ô∏è Business tools and interfaces

Camino Suite 2.0 brings significant upgrades to the platform's interface. Integration with external wallets like Metamask and Fireblocks, combined with FIAT gateway implementation, will simplify payment processing for travel businesses.

The new Camino Name Service will introduce user-friendly addressing across all chains, making asset management more straightforward for companies. Today's crypto addresses like this `0x4c9c40...796ef0` will become `YourCompanyName.CAM`

## ‚õ±Ô∏è Web3 travel solutions

The CLINKS system will introduce one-click booking capabilities through standardized blockchain actions. This development will reduce technical complexity while making it easier for travel businesses to integrate blockchain features into existing systems.

Digital ID for travel businesses will also be in focus due to its alignment with European travel standards, which are needed for streamlined check-in processes to ensure GDPR compliance. This system will better protect customer data while reducing fraud risks.

## üí¨ B2B travel business communication on-chain

Camino Messenger will mature with new message types and improved error handling. The growth team will be focused on connecting more travel service providers and distributors to the messenger, opening new levels of connectivity and new business models to legacy systems.

An upgraded CaminoScan will boost the network's transparency and visibility of transactions and statistics across all chains, helping businesses track on-chain operations effectively.

## üèõÔ∏è On-chain governance

The Camino Governance will receive new functionalities for network governance. These will allow validators securing the network to participate in on-chain decision-making processes like transaction fee adjustments (reminder: transaction fees are fixed) by submitting proposals and voting. This makes Camino Network the most transparent and collaborative travel infrastructure available.

## üîß Other technical infrastructure developments

Throughout 2025, Camino Network will evolve as a more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly blockchain platform specifically designed for travel industry needs thanks to:

- AI-powered integration tools
- Standardized APIs for travel operations
- Cross-chain communication

## ü™ô CAM accessibility

Following [Gate.io's](http://gate.io/) interest in listing CAM, the Camino Network Foundation is in discussions with additional centralized exchanges (CEX) to expand token accessibility. The Foundation is also exploring opportunities to bring decentralized exchanges (DEX) to Camino Network in a secure and compliant way.

New partnerships in development will introduce travel-focused decentralized applications and use cases, expanding utility options for CAM token holders.
