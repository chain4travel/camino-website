Camino Messenger is a new digital product built on top of Camino Network. It transforms how travel companies connect, exchange, and sell their travel products. Instead of building and maintaining multiple APIs with each new partner, companies can connect once to Camino Messenger and reach the entire network. 

It operates on the Camino Messenger Protocol ‚Äî a new universal language for travel distribution. Using standardized message types, partners can easily share or request data about travel services like hotels, tours, and beyond.
