<p>From the very first days of Camino Network development, the security of data and the network itself has been the top priority. This commitment led to finding a reliable, trustworthy partner for code auditing, vulnerability reporting, recommendations, and long-term collaboration. That partner is Hexens io.</p>

<p>Hexens is a company with huge experience in cybersecurity, having provided audit reports to big names like Polygon Labs, Lido, Celo, and many others. Their reputation and results made them the ideal choice for Camino Network.</p>

<h2>Camino Network: Security Report </h2>

<p>The audit report provided to Camino Network Foundation identified nine minor issues, all of which were promptly addressed and fixed to sustain the integrity of the network. The absence of major concerns in the report clearly showcases that from day one, the top priority was rooted in high-quality coding practices and top-notch development.</p>
