<h2>The road to the mainnet and beyond</h2>

<p>
    In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology, understanding a network's strategy for launching its mainnet is crucial for the team, users, developers, potential investors, and the broader community. Find the insights into this complex process of Camino Network â€” the first layer 1 blockchain for the travel industry.
</p>

<blockquote>
    The planned stages of the mainnet launch help the network grow healthy and organically with prompt feedback from the validators to developers fixing and improving the system.
</blockquote>

<h2>Build, test, audit, go live</h2>

<p>The mainnet launch is a critical milestone for Camino Network. It represents the transition from a test network to the first fully operational blockchain ecosystem for the travel industry. After being security audited on the testnet, the network has undergone rigorous testing and validation to ensure its robust and scalable nature. This work with validators and developers is an ongoing process that tunes the system, addressing any potential issues.</p>

<p>With the mainnet launch, Camino Network opens the doors to a new era of possibilities for all travel-related companies. The network's architecture is designed to handle the unique requirements of the travel industry, enabling faster, more secure transactions, streamlined data exchange, and enhanced connectivity across the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>New connectivity for the travel companies</h2>

<p>Travel companies are able to start leveraging the power of blockchain technology to optimize their operations, improve customer experiences, and drive innovation in areas such as booking and reservations, loyalty programs, supply chain management, and many others.</p>

<p>Camino Network is built with the vision of continuous and organic growth and evolution. The network embraces a culture of innovation, fostering collaboration with developers, partners, industry stakeholders, and travelers. This collaborative approach drives the development of new products to enhance the travel experience and reshape the industry.</p>

<h2>Key components of success</h2>

<p>There are several key components that are essential for the successful operation of the Camino blockchain:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Robust code which must be thoroughly tested (link to the article about the report on Camino Network blog) and secure, capable of running smoothly on validators' computers worldwide. These validators play a crucial role in providing computing resources and securing the network.</li>
    <li>Developer engagement to launch innovative web3 products and decentralized applications on Camino Network. Their active participation is vital for the growth and success of the whole web3 travel ecosystem.</li>
    <li>Strategic partnerships to add value to the web3 travel ecosystem. Collaborating with industry leaders and complementary platforms enhances the capabilities and reach of the network, benefitting all the participants.</li>
    <li>Token distribution plays a pivotal role in fostering engagement within the Camino Network. Tokens should be in the hands of stakeholders who actively bond, develop products, and support the ecosystem in various ways.</li>
    <li>Global ambassadors network is spreading awareness, promoting the mission, and educating people about the benefits of blockchain technology and the potential of Camino Network for the global travel market.</li>
</ul>

<p>The success of Camino Network strongly depends on the broader market's understanding and enthusiasm for blockchain solutions in the travel industry. As the market becomes more receptive to blockchain technology, it creates opportunities for adoption and growth. The number of big brands joining the space and building new products on blockchain proves the perfect timing for such a web3 travel ecosystem to be built.</p>

<h2>The mainnet roadmap and timeline</h2>

<p>Camino Network has launched the mainnet in carefully planned stages. Each stage is defined by specific restrictions and goals, allowing the dev teams to test the functionality and promptly address any issues thoroughly. This approach provides flexibility and ensures the delivery of a robust and secure web3 ecosystem for the travel industry.</p>

<h3>The mainnet (Restricted)</h3>

<p>Date: April 24, 2023</p>

<p>Camino Network operates under a hybrid Proof of Stake and Authority (PoSA) model. The primary objective at this stage is to distribute initial tokens to early-stage investors and contributors to onboard the first group of validators.</p>

<p>Developers ready to deploy their smart contracts to the test net can create wallets with KYC and start building on the blockchain. Simultaneously, the team behind Camino Network continues operating the test net (Columbus) with a variety of validators to optimize all validation processes. Once both the Camino Network and validators are confident in the stability of the testnet, the activities transition to the subsequent phase.</p>

<h3>The mainnet</h3>

<p>Dates: mid-May 2023</p>

<p>Since the Camino Network mainnet infrastructure is up and running, more validators are getting onboarded to the blockchain.</p>

<p>There are several objectives for this phase:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Verify that the mainnet is functioning correctly with a decentralized group of validators, and continue with code and security reviews.</li>
    <li>Initiate the launch of applications that can operate on the mainnet.</li>
    <li>Prepare the processes for easy-to-go onboarding of validators.</li>
    <li>Testing of release management, Upgrades/patches, and Phases.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mainnet (Community Governed)</h3>

<p>Dates: July 17, 2023 </p>

<p>Athens update is the stage when the network is entirely functional without any restrictions, and all the validators are invited to add their validator nodes.</p>

<h3>Post mainnet</h3>

<p>The team is currently in the final stages of preparing the post-mainnet roadmap. A comprehensive plan that outlines the features and milestones that lie ahead is being crafted. Stay tuned for the upcoming posts with further details.</p>

<h2>How to join Camino Network</h2>
