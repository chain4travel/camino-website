The travel industry has long been fragmented by numerous APIs, disjointed systems, and inefficient data exchange. Camino Messenger aims to solve these pain points with a wallet-to-wallet (W2W) communication system designed specifically for travel businesses.

### Camino Messenger:
- cuts costs, even for businesses that have many searches to achieve a booking
- connects with new yet verified partners more easily
- makes communication fluent with a unified data standard for all participants

Built on Camino Network, the blockchain designed by travel tech professionals for the global travel community, it allows secure, fast, and cost-effective travel product distribution, all powered by CAM tokens. 

> Everyone from a large hotel chain to a small tour operator can use Camino Messenger to streamline data exchange, connect with partners, and automate operations.

The Messenger abstracts blockchain for users. The system operates via the Partner Configurator and Camino Bots, which are used to read the blockchain data and mint NFTs. This setup offers several benefits: a single, reliable source of truth, secure and transparent transactions backed by KYC and KYB, and low-cost payments. It also reduces the complexity of managing multiple APIs.

## Unique Value for Early Adopters

[Camino Network Foundation](https://foundation.camino.network/) offers early adopters a grant of 20,000 CAM tokens. This grant allows businesses to cover over 66 million messages, offering a risk-free way to test and experience all the benefits Camino Messenger provides. This grant provides the perfect opportunity for businesses to experiment with the messenger's functionality and gain firsthand experience in blockchain-powered travel distribution with no financial risks.

### Better Together: Bring a Partner

To accelerate the integration, the Foundation encourages businesses to onboard a partner they already work with through traditional APIs. This setup allows seamless transition and faster testing with familiar entities. When you and your partner connect to Camino Messenger, each will receive a grant of 20,000 CAM, if completed in 2024. Once the data exchange begins, an additional 20,000 CAM tokens will be split between the two businesses, making the entire process financially attractive. Moreover, both companies will receive full onboarding support to ensure a smooth integration.
