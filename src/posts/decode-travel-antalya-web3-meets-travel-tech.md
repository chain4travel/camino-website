From November 13-15, Chain4Travel, builders of Camino Network, brought together over 30 participants from 8 countries for a 2.5-day hackathon. Hosted at SAN TSG's HQ in Antalya, the event—Decode Travel—showcased the transformative potential of blockchain for the travel industry.

Just like in the previous [Decode Travel hackathon in Berlin](https://camino.network/decode-travel-recap/), developers had a 48-hour sprint to learn, code, and deploy a solution on Camino Network. This tight timeframe helps to bridge web3 and travel industries, with blockchain developers learning about travel challenges and travel professionals embracing the possibilities of blockchain.

## Challenges

Decode Travel always brings real challenges to the travel industry. Therefore, hackers use Camino Network to solve problems that companies face right now:

1) Micropayments: Streamline tourism transactions with automated smart contracts.
2) Personalization: Resolve the personalization-privacy paradox using AI and zero-knowledge proofs.
3) Camino Messenger: Build decentralized applications using the [Camino Messenger](https://docs.camino.network/camino-messenger) protocol.

### CrypTourists

Team CrypTourists tackled the micropayments challenge by developing a solution on Camino Network: creating an interface that interacts seamlessly with Camino Messenger to manage booking content. As an added feature, the team built a smart contract for automatic dispute resolution and payment settlements, ensuring smoother transactions and minimizing errors from all parties: provider, distributor, and traveler.

*The key feature of blockchain that made their solution possible are smart contracts. They allow for the automated, secure, and trustless execution of agreements in a peer-to-peer manner.*

### Wild Geese

Team Wild Geese (Petour/ Technoly company) focused on building a smart contract designed to resolve payment disputes and delays for service providers and tour operators. Their system turned complex micropayments into an efficient, automated distribution process with the help of Camino Network. This approach creates a faster, more transparent, and reliable payment experience for vendors and customers, improving profitability and trust in the industry.

*For Team Wild Geese, the essential feature is blockchain’s decentralized and immutable ledger serving as a single source of truth, which ensures transparent, reliable, and efficient transaction processing, making complex micropayment distributions seamless and trustworthy.*

### Camino Pilgrims

Team Camino Pilgrims focused on bringing the upselling process in travel bookings to a new level of profitability, addressing the challenge faced by TraSo's customers, a top vendor in Germany's dynamic packaging tour operator systems. With billions of travel offers sent daily and millions of booking requests received, post-booking processes often lead to upselling losses for OTAs, expected to exceed 50%.

For this challenge, the team chose a car rental booking scenario as an example of how blockchain can enhance upselling. Their solution involved a new protocol enabling the secure storage and sharing of customer data among Camino business partners, creating a seamless connection between an OTA and a car rental company.

*Camino Pilgrims leveraged blockchain's security and transparency, using it as a single source of truth for customer data verification for easy and profitable upselling.*

### The Rookies

Team "The Rookies" aimed to tackle data privacy and GDPR challenges associated with storing customer data. Their solution addresses the lack of transparency customers face regarding the handling of their data and the risks posed by data breaches. The team developed “TIV”, a platform that applies Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles, giving travelers ownership and control over their digital identities.

Smart contracts were used to streamline processes like car rental bookings, making them more efficient and transparent. The solution also incorporated selective data disclosure, allowing travelers to provide consent and share only the necessary details for each activity, safeguarding sensitive information.

*The team used blockchain to create secure digital identities for travelers. This made customer data safer and check-ins faster. The solutions could potentially cut costs for both businesses and travelers.*

### My Friend

Team "My Friend" focused on making travel packaging more engaging and personalized. Traditional packaging often fails to create an emotional connection with consumers and lacks personalization, leading to missed brand differentiation and consumer engagement opportunities. Additionally, the inefficiency from the overproduction of travel offers contributes to higher costs, estimated as Look2Book-ratio.

The team created a solution based on an inspirational dynamic packaging system powered by generative AI and Camino Messenger for sourcing travel services. The B2C chatbot helped users to provide personal preferences through a conversation, triggering requests to Camino Messenger, and ultimately creating personalized bookings — acting like an AI-powered travel agency offering tailored experiences.

*Camino Messenger enables real-time data flow for personalized offers to be created for faster responses, deeper engagement, and more personalization for travelers.*

### SunExpress

SunExpress focused on leveraging the Camino Messenger for distribution purposes, by integrating with the Messenger, the airline aimed to find new ways to improve its distribution network for more efficient communication and transaction processes across its business partners.

### Paximum

Paximum (part of SAN TSG) tackled the challenge of managing multiple data sources and lengthy settlement times between B2B partners. Their solution involved developing a smart contract system that automates the disbursement of commissions and payments to various partners directly within their core booking systems for higher trust and efficiency.

## Jury

Teams pitched their solutions in 10-minute presentations. Solutions were scored on their technical viability, market potential, and presentation clarity. Extra points went to teams who extended existing functionality in creative ways.

## What’s next

Travel tech companies gain three critical advantages from hackathons: rapid team education in new technologies like blockchain, quick solutions to business challenges built on Camino Network, and strong brand positioning as innovators. It combines practical learning, problem-solving, team, and brand building into one focused event.

> Our winning solution integrated AI with the Camino Messenger to create personalized and inspiring booking experiences. From the start, we recognized the potential of the solution to create something innovative and unique in the travel industry. We even purchased the domain during the event. Work is underway, and we're excited to launch the first version soon.
