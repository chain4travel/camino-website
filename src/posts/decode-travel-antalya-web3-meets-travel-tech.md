From November 13-15, Chain4Travel, builders of Camino Network, brought together over 30 participants from 8 countries for a 2.5-day hackathon. Hosted at SAN TSG's HQ in Antalya, the event—Decode Travel—showcased the transformative potential of blockchain for the travel industry.

Just like in the previous [Decode Travel hackathon in Berlin](https://camino.network/decode-travel-recap/), developers had a 48-hour sprint to learn, code, and deploy a solution on Camino Network. This tight timeframe helps to bridge web3 and travel industries, with blockchain developers learning about travel challenges and travel professionals embracing the possibilities of blockchain.

## Challenges

Decode Travel always brings real challenges to the travel industry. Therefore, hackers use Camino Network to solve problems that companies face right now:

1) Micropayments: Streamline tourism transactions with automated smart contracts.
2) Personalization: Resolve the personalization-privacy paradox using AI and zero-knowledge proofs.
3) Camino Messenger: Build decentralized applications using the Camino Messenger protocol.
