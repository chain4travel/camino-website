This policy (“Privacy Policy”, together with our Terms of Use ) explains and sets out the basis for why and when we collect personal information about the people who visit our website(s), how we use it, the conditions under which we may disclose it to others and the measures we take to keep it secure.

By visiting this website you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this policy. Please note that this includes consenting to the collection and processing of any personal information you provide, as described below. We may amend this policy from time to time so please check it occasionally to ensure that you agree with any changes. Your continued use of our website(s) will constitute your acceptance of, and agreement to, any changes.

## What information do we collect?

## Personal information you disclose to us

We collect and use your personal data exclusively within the framework of European Union and German data protection legislation. 

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when expressing an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, when participating in activities on the Services or otherwise contacting us.

The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect can include the following:

- Name and Contact Data. We collect your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.

- Credentials: We collect passwords, password hints, and similar security information used for authentication and account access.

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

## Information automatically collected

In Short: Some information such as IP address and/or browser and device characteristics - is collected automatically when you visit our Services.

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.

## How do we use your information?

We use personal information collected via our Services for a variety of business purposes described below. We process your personal information for these purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our legal obligations. We indicate the specific processing grounds we rely on next to each purpose listed below.

We use the information we collect or receive:
We and/or our third party marketing partners may use the personal information you send to us for our marketing purposes, if this is in accordance with your marketing preferences. You can opt-out of our marketing emails at any time. 

- Request Feedback. We may use your information to request feedback and to contact you about your use of our Services.

- To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users. We may use your information to respond to your inquiries and solve any potential issues you might have with the use of our Services.

- For other Business Purposes. We may use your information for other business purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve our services, products, marketing and your experience. We may use and store this information in aggregated and anonymized form so that it is not associated with individual end users and does not include personal information. We will not use identifiable personal information without your consent.

## Will your information be shared with anyone?

We may process or share data based on the following legal basis:

**Consent**: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information in a specific purpose.

**Legitimate Interests**: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.

**Performance of a Contract**: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.

**Legal Obligations**: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements)

**Vital Interests**: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:

**Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers.** We may share your data with third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology on the Services, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the Services over time. This information may be used to, among other things analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. Unless described in this policy, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional purposes. We have contracts in place with our data processors. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They will hold it securely and retain it for the period we instruct.

**Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company

## Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Policy.

## Is your information transferred internationally?

Our hosting servers are operated by Netlify, which uses CDN. The CDN nodes are geographically aware, and make sure that if you are working from a coffee shop in Tokyo, that video your laptop is requesting is coming from the server just up the street, not being pushed from a server farm in San Francisco. The whole purpose of a CDN is to put that video as close to users as possible to avoid latency issues. 

We will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable law.

## How long do we keep your information?

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## How do we keep your information safe?

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.

## Do we collect information from minors?

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable, measures to promptly delete such data from our records.

If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at hello@chain4travel.com

## What happens in case of data breach?

A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You will be notified about data breaches when Chain4Travel believes you are likely to be at risk of serious harm. For example, a data breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the event that Chain4Travel becomes aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information Chain4Travel will promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not less than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the right and freedoms of natural persons.

## What are control mechanisms for do-not-track-features?

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice a revised version of this privacy policy.

## Do Californian residents have specific privacy rights?

California Civil Code Section 1798. 83, also known as the"Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we share personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.

## Do we make updates on this policy?

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.

This policy was last updated in November 2022.
