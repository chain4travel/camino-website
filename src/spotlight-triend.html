<h2>Triend‚Äôs dApp built on Camino Network</h2>
<p>
	By adopting Camino Network's blockchain technology, Triend reshapes the review
	landscape, focusing exclusively on decentralizing travel reviews to foster
	trust, transparency, and ownership. Leveraging Camino Network, Triend creates
	an immutable record of reviews and transactions, effectively eliminating fake
	reviews and enhancing trust in the feedback provided by travelers.
</p>
<p>
	Smart contracts automate and secure the review process, while tokenization
	offers rewards to users for their genuine contributions, encouraging quality
	feedback and active participation. This system not only makes it more
	difficult for businesses to manipulate reviews but also empowers customers,
	giving them ownership of their data and contributions.

<h2>Leveraging Web3 technologies to reshape travel reviews</h2>

<h3>Trusted reviews</h3>
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-12 border-b border-gray-700">
	<p class="col-span-2 md:col-span-1 pb-4 md:pb-6 m-0">
		<strong>üö´ Problem</strong>: Reviews are a key driver for travel planning and decision-making. However, for both
		travelers and businesses, unreliable reviews and, increasingly, the problem of fake reviews are becoming a
		concern.
	</p>
	<p class="col-span-2 md:col-span-1 pb-4 md:pb-6 m-0">
		<strong>‚úÖ Solution with Triend</strong>: Triend increases the credibility and trustworthiness of feedback by
		implementing a blockchain-based protocol that directly links reviews to verified transactions. This
		significantly reduces the possibility of fake reviews, as only genuine customers can submit reviews.
	</p>
</div>
<h3>Decentralized system</h3>
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-12 border-b border-gray-700">
	<p class="col-span-2 md:col-span-1 pb-4 md:pb-6 m-0">
		<strong>üö´ Problem</strong>: Centralized platforms such as Booking.com have the power to manipulate by
		selectively displaying reviews. This centralized control can undermine the trustworthiness of reviews.
	</p>
	<p class="col-span-2 md:col-span-1 pb-4 md:pb-6 m-0">
		<strong>‚úÖ Solution with Triend</strong>: Triend's decentralized review system shifts the ownership of reviews
		back to the users. Leveraging blockchain technology ensures that reviews are transparent and immune to
		manipulation by any centralized authority, increasing trust and authenticity.
	</p>
</div>
<h3>Rewarded participation</h3>
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-12 border-b border-gray-700">
	<p class="col-span-2 md:col-span-1 pb-4 md:pb-6 m-0">
		<strong>üö´ Problem</strong>: Most customers don't write reviews. This lack of participation can result in a
		skewed representation of customer experiences dominated by extreme positive or negative feedback.
	</p>
	<p class="col-span-2 md:col-span-1 pb-4 md:pb-6 m-0">
		<strong>‚úÖ Solution with Triend</strong>: To encourage broader participation, Triend implements a reward-driven
		mechanism. By receiving Triend tokens and NFTs when giving feedback linked to special perks and rewards, Triend
		aims to motivate a larger segment of users to share their honest feedback.
