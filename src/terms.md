3.5. FAILURE TO KEEP YOUR CAMINO WALLET SAFE OR FAILURE TO REMEMBER YOUR CAMINO WALLET DETAILS OR YOUR EXTERNAL NON-CUSTODIAL WALLET PRIVATE KEY MAY RESULT IN YOUR CAMINO WALLET BECOMING PERMANENTLY INACCESSIBLE AND/OR THE PERMANENT LOSS OF THE DIGITAL ASSETS STORED IN YOUR CAMINO WALLET.

**5.- On-chain fees**

You understand and acknowledge that all on-chain transactions incur gas fees upon execution. Before submitting a transfer or a swap transaction the Camino Wallet will present you with an estimation of the gas fee, required for the fulfillment of your desired transaction. The Camino Wallet will pay on your behalf the gas fees associated with your desired transaction. Upon completion of your transaction, the Camino Wallet will deduct the actual gas fee amount from the transacted amount.

**6.- Risk Disclosure**

6.1. Digital Assets are more volatile relative to most fiat currencies, and other assets, and this unpredictability of their price may result in significant losses over a short period. We are not responsible for the Digital Assets market, and we make no representations or warranties concerning the real or perceived value of any Digital Assets and the quality, suitability, truth, usefulness, accuracy, or completeness of any data provided by CNF. You shall, therefore, carefully consider whether holding Digital Assets is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.

6.3. You understand and agree that you use the Camino Wallet and the related Services at your own risk. This section is not exhaustive and does not disclose all the risks associated with the Digital Assets and the use of the Camino Wallet.
