      <p class="text-body mb-8">Camino is a consortium blockchain developed by Chain4Travel AG and operated and governed by market participants of the travel industry. Camino combines permissioned and permissionless blockchain solutions to solve the blockchain trilemma in favor of scalability while still being open to new participants, thus, becoming a semi- permissioned blockchain.</p>
      <p class="text-body">Chain4Travel AG sets out to create an environment that fosters the creation of new travel-related products by providing a tech stack that fulfills the needs of established travel companies while opening the field for new players in the market, too. In short, C4T aims to create an ecosystem that will boost the travel industry by enabling a new way of dealing with B2B2C travel. That ecosystem is powered by its native token: Camino.</p>
