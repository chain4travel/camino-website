<p>Bogowi is a Web3 travel platform built on Camino Network that transforms every booking into a verified act of conservation.</p>

<p>With each booking, travelers earn BOGO tokens, receive NFT travel passes, and vote on where a portion of booking revenue is invested ‚Äî funding local environmental projects in the very destinations they visit.</p>

<p>From beach cleanups to coral restoration, every journey contributes to the health of the planet ‚Äî transparently, traceably, and community-led.</p>

<h2>How Camino Enables the Impact Engine</h2>

<p>Bogowi integrates Camino Network's travel-focused blockchain to power:</p>

<ul>
    <li>NFT-based booking passes minted on-chain as digital collectibles</li>
    <li>Tokenized reward system based on conservation impact, referrals & gamified actions</li>
    <li>DAO governance for funding local projects voted on by travelers and hosts</li>
    <li>Secure payment infrastructure supporting both fiat & crypto</li>
</ul>

<p>The platform uses Camino's Web3 connectivity to handle identity, payments, messaging, and DAO voting ‚Äî tailored specifically for real-world tourism use cases.</p>
