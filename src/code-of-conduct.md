# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This Code of Conduct helps us build a community that is rooted in kindness, collaboration, and mutual respect. The following describes our expectations and the consequences of unacceptable behavior. We encourage you to read it so that you can follow along with the conversations happening on this site.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to respect and foster a community where people can feel welcome and appreciated. We also pledge to treat each other with respect, even when we disagree.

We understand that the open source community is made up of many different types of people who have differing opinions about what should be included in our policies. Everyone has their own idea about what makes a good code of conduct, but we are all here because we care about making sure everyone has an enjoyable experience contributing to open source projects. We believe that having this one central document will help us work closely together as a team while keeping everyone informed on how they can contribute even more effectively over time!

## Our Standards

- Be respectful, be civil and be collaborative
- Be empathetic and considerate
- Be open, honest and transparent
- Be accountable, reliable and dependable
- Respect confidentiality

## Unacceptable behaviour

These are just a few examples, and you can always consult a team member if you have any questions.

- Offending, aggressive comments towards individuals or other projects on any medium of communication.
- Knowingly distributing false information.
- Harassing other individuals or projects.

## Scope of Application

This document applies to all community members, paid or unpaid, contractors, temporary staff, interns and volunteers. It also applies to all interactions between community members regardless of the project, medium or technology used.

## Reporting​

Harmful content: Every person contributes to building a kind, respectful community. If you find unacceptable behavior directed at yourself or others, please contact us.

Bugs: Please understand that this network is, despite its success, an experiment with potential flaws, so it’s appreciated that community members help report any sort of exploits directly to the team before sharing publicly. 

Please submit your reports to <a href="mailto:hello@chain4travel.com">hello@chain4travel.com</a>.

## Conclusion
We think that our Code of Conduct is a good first step towards making our community more inclusive. We will continue to refine it and make it even better in the future, but we're excited about what we've laid out here today!
