# Code of Conduct

The purpose of this code of conduct (“Code of Conduct”) is to define how the ecosystem participants of the Camino Network (the “Camino Network Community”) should interact on a day-to-day basis. It also reflects the day-to-day operations, core values and overall culture of the Camino Network Community. 

The Camino Network Community is currently a safe and inclusive space, and the following Code of Conduct will enable our Camino Network Community to maintain these qualities as we learn and grow. 

The Camino Network Community does not want to censor its members, but sometimes it can be unclear where the line is on a particular issue, so this Code of Conduct seeks to clarify some expectations of members behaviour and provide guidance on how best be part of the Camino Network Community <a href="#footnote-1">1</a>. 

We encourage all the members of the Camino Network Community to keep an open mind, and to commit to being thoughtful when sharing knowledge. 

## 1.- Respectful communication

All members of the Camino Network Community:

- shall engage in respectful and professional communication, treating each other with courtesy, empathy, and open-mindedness. Maintain a constructive and positive tone in all interactions and avoid any form of derogatory, offensive, or disrespectful language. No messages with derogatory or inflammatory remarks about an individual or group’s race, religion, national origin, physical attributes, or sexual and political preferences will be tolerated. 
- will act in such a way that sets an example of responsible behaviour. Abusing the Camino Network Community’s official channels in any way or form will not be tolerated.  

## 2.- No spam

All members shall post content that must be on-topic and constructive. Promotional content, content designed to create backlinks, trolling, links to harmful websites, or content unrelated to the topic at hand may be removed.

## 3.- No tolerance for abuse

Our goal is for everyone in our community to feel welcome, which is why we encourage our members to embrace and promote inclusivity and diversity within the Camino Network Community. Respect and value the differences in backgrounds, perspectives, and ideas of all members. Foster an environment where everyone feels welcome, regardless of their gender, race, ethnicity, age, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic. 

## 4.- Respect members’ time

All members live within their own circumstances and may have more or less time to devote to Camino Network Community than you do. Respect the level of participation that other members choose. You can always request input from other members, but it is entirely up to them if they wish to give it.

## 5.- Collaboration and Cooperation

Encourage collaboration and cooperation among the members of the Camino Network Community. Share knowledge, expertise, and resources to collectively advance the goals of the Camino Network Community. Foster a culture of teamwork, constructive feedback, and support to drive innovation and progress.

Anyone that chooses not to contribute and then later complains about the outcome of those actions ends up undermining the efforts of all members. As a member, if you want to see a specific outcome become a reality, it is up to you to make it happen. Get involved, make proposals, support your vision and see it become reality. 

## 6.- Respect confidentiality 

Members of the Camino Network Community receiving or holding information, regardless of the subject matter, issued through the Camino Network Community’s official communication channels will handle this information responsibly and protect it against inadvertent disclosure to unauthorised parties. Data should only be disclosed on a need-to-know basis and privacy must be maintained.  

## 7.- Compliance with Laws and Regulations 

Members of the Camino Network Community are required to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations whenever and wherever they act on behalf of the Camino Network Community or participate in Camino Network Community activities, and to encourage others to do the same. 

All members must comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations, and promptly report any transaction that could be expected to give rise to a violation of this Code of Conduct or a conflict of interest.

## 8.- Operate with integrity

The level of success Camino Network Community can achieve is highly correlated to the level of trust reached between its members. It is expected that all the Camino Network Community members reject inappropriate pressure from industry or others and avoid relationships that impair, or may appear to impair, the Camino Network Community’s objectivity and independence. Furthermore, members must not intentionally injure or impugn the professional reputation or practice of the other members. 

## 9.- Continuous Learning and Improvement

All members are encouraged to foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the Camino Network Community. Stay updated with the latest advancements and best practices in blockchain technology and contribute to the collective knowledge of the Camino Network Community. Actively seek opportunities for personal and professional growth.

## 10.- Conflict Resolution

Resolve conflicts or disputes that may arise within the Camino Network Community in a professional and respectful manner. Encourage open dialogue, active listening, and seek consensus-building to find mutually agreeable solutions. Avoid engaging in public disputes that may harm the reputation or unity of the Camino Network Community.

## 11.- Enforcement Responsabilities

The Camino Network Foundation is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standard of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that it deems inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. 

The Camino Network Foundation reserves the right to remove content that does not meet the standards set forth in this Code of Conduct and will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate. The Camino Network Foundation also reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to prohibit individual users from participating in the Camino Network Community. 

## 12.- Compliance with the guidelines of the Camino Network Community 

Adhere to all policies, guidelines, and regulations set forth by the Camino Network Community. This includes meeting deadlines, fulfilling commitments, and actively participating in the Camino Network Community initiatives, meetings, and projects. Seek to contribute to the achievement of the Camino Network Community's objectives and goals.

## 13.- Adherence to the Code of Conduct

All members of the Camino Network Community are expected to uphold and promote this Code of Conduct.
